# I3M Chain Bridge

The **I3M Chain Bridge** is a bridge module that integrates multiple components from the I3M Engine with the Internet Computer Protocol (ICP). This bridge provides a decentralized solution for managing various functionalities such as animations, UI, sound, resources, and more across distributed systems, leveraging ICP’s decentralized infrastructure.

## Introduction

The I3M Chain Bridge is part of the I3M ecosystem, designed to enable seamless interoperability between the various modules within the I3M Engine and the Internet Computer Protocol. By bridging functionalities like animations, sound, UI, and resource management, it provides a comprehensive suite for building decentralized applications on the ICP platform. This project takes advantage of ICP’s capabilities to deliver distributed, scalable, and secure solutions.

## Features

- **On-Chain Module Integration**: Deploy and manage various modules on the ICP, including animations, UI, sound, and more.
- **Decentralized Processing**: Utilizes ICP’s distributed network to ensure reliable, decentralized execution.
- **WebAssembly Support**: Leverages WebAssembly for high-performance execution of Rust-based modules on-chain.
- **Multi-Module Compatibility**: Integrates with various modules like `i3m-animation`, `i3m-sound`, `i3m-ui`, and more for a robust feature set.

## Modules

The I3M Chain Bridge includes the following modules:

- **i3m**: Core functionalities for the I3M Engine.
- **i3m-animation**: Manages and renders animations.
- **i3m-core**: Core utilities and functions used across modules.
- **i3m-core-derive**: Derivation utilities for the I3M core.
- **i3m-dylib**: Dynamic library loading support.
- **i3m-graph**: Manages graphical elements and rendering.
- **i3m-impl**: Core implementation details.
- **i3m-math**: Math utilities for graphics and physics calculations.
- **i3m-resource**: Manages resource loading and handling.
- **i3m-scripts**: Supports scripting for modular behaviors.
- **i3m-sound**: Sound management and playback.
